## ZIP

Python's zip() function "pairs up" the elements of multiple iterables to create a new iterable.

-   The elements returned from this iterable will be tuples, and the tuples will contain the pairwise elements of the original iterables.

Example:

```{python}
first_name = ['Albert', 'Chris', 'Jen']
last_name = ['Waldron', 'Kinkade', 'Sherwood']
zipped = zip(first_name, last_name) #zip of two lists 
#it is creating a generator
print(zipped)

# create a list, using the new "zipped" iterable
zip_list = list(zipped) #creates a list of the paired iterables
print(zip_list)

# create the zip list directly
zip_list2 = list(zip(first_name, last_name))
print(zip_list2)
```

The way you can use the generator is you can access it:

```{python}
print(zip(first_name, last_name))

print(i for i in zip(first_name, last_name)) #for ea element in the generator
```

For a, b in zip(first_name, last_name), Python will interpret that line. Now, because the 'list' = (zip(first_name, last_name)) is creating tuples, for things that look like a, b, Python is going to say, "For a to be the 1st element of each tuple and for b to be the 2nd element of each tuple". Therefore, when we print each of the "a's" an output it just the elements in the first list: 'Albert', 'Chris', 'Jen'.

```{python}
print([a for a, b in zip(first_name, last_name)])
```

```{python}
#To show the generator disappears
print(list((zipped)))
print()

print(zip_list)
```
